# Proposed Solution
Our Prototype gives a [video sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYUCJZqV1dfV9VXl2k490NXHeo9TZRyw/view?usp=sharing/) marking the tree and also predicting following on [UI](https://mail2jrohit.github.io/Drone_Based_Biodiversity_Management/):
   1. Identitfying the green cover.
   2. Calculating the total area of green cover.
   3. Indentifying the tree diversity.

This will help us finding many intrinsic details about the diversity of region and thus will help us plan sustainable development.
